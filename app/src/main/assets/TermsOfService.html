<h2> Terms of Service </h2>


<font face="arial" size="3">
  <br>
  By continuing to use this Application (the "App") you accept the following Terms of
  Service (the "terms").
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Contacting Emergency Services -
  <br>
  <br>
  The App IS NOT a substitute for the regular means of contacting emergency services such as a fixed-line
  or mobile (cell) phone. Even if your mobile device and the App have connectivity to the cellular network,
  the App has no control over whether alerts will be sent in real-time, received and/or responded to by
  any recipient promptly. If you are in danger, have met with an accident or are the victim of a crime
  please call the authorities immediately. DO NOT rely solely on the App in these situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  We may update these terms at any time. To stay current on these terms please check back frequently.
