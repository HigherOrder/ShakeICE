         <h3>  Setting up the app  </h3>
         <font face="arial" size="2">
           <b> Step 1 </b>  - Select the persons (contacts) you would like to alert in case of an emergency. You may add as many contacts as you wish.
           <br>
           <br>
           <b> Step 2 </b>  - Test the set up. You might want to select just one contact to test. Shake your device <em> vigorously, in wide sweeps </em> for about 3-4 seconds (or until the device vibrates).
           <br>
           The app will send two SMSs to the contact(s) you selected in Step 1:
           <br>
           1) an SMS with an alert message, and
           <br>
           2) an SMS with your approximate street address and geolocation (latitude and longitude).
           <br>
           If you have marked a contact as your primary contact, then the app will also place a phone call to that contact.
           <br>
           <br>
           <b>Step 3</b> - Close the app and use the device as usual. If Steps 1 and 2 were completed correctly, you have finished setting up the app. The app will now run in the background for as long as the device is on.
           <br>
           <br>
           Note - The app will send your location only if you have enabled Location via Settings. If you have enabled Location, but are not connected to the Internet, then the app will send the your Geo location (i.e. latitude and longitude of your location). If you are also connected to the Internet, then the app will send your street address instead.
           <br>
           <br>
           Launch the app to see your current location.
           <br>
           <br>
           <b> If you are in an emergency situation and want to alert your emergency contacts, just shake your phone or tablet as you did in Step 2. </b>
           <br>
           <br>
           <em> <b> You do not need to open the app in order for it to work. </b> </em>
           <br>
         </font>
         <br>
         <br>
         <h3> How does it work? </h3>
         <font face="arial" size="2">
           The app works by monitoring the g-force acting on your device. When the g-force exceeds a certain value, the app alerts the emergency contacts you have selected.
           <br>
           <br>
           Note - The \'g\' is the unit of measure of acceleration due to gravity, also know as g-force. One g is the g-force experienced at the Earth\'s surface.
           <br>
           <br>
           <em> Watch how the g-force changes when you are riding a roller coaster or are traveling in an elevator. </em>
           <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           The app uses your GPS coordinates to ascertain your location. To get your street address you will need to be connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi or 3G (having just a 2G connection is not sufficient).
